Files for Codame Interactive Art Workshops

Instructions for Use:
Click the big green CODE button and select "download as zip." This will download a zip file to your computer. Unzip the file. To run sketches, double click on the file. Arduino may ask you to relocate the sketch to another folder. Click "OK." This will open up the sketch in the Arduino IDE. Make sure you have the correct port and board selected for your Circuit Playground Express, then click the forward button to upload the sketch to the Circuit Playground Express. 

Class 2: 9/3 PREREQUISITES 

Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system

If you are using WINDOWS install the driver.

Install SAMD Boards

Make sure your Circuit Playground Express is working and you can upload / run code! To test this, try uploading the Hello_Blink sketch and see if the red indicator LED blinks! If you need help, visit the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express's help section.

Note: we will not be covering Arduino basics in this class, but feel free to review last week's course materials using the slideshow listed at: http://www.mirabellejones.com/Codame/
