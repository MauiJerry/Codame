# Codame
Files for Codame Interactive Art Workshops

Instructions for Use:
Click the big green CODE button and select "download as zip." This will download a zip file to your computer. Unzip the file. To run sketches, double click on the file. Arduino may ask you to relocate the sketch to another folder. Click "OK." This will open up the sketch in the Arduino IDE. Make sure you have the correct port and board selected for your Circuit Playground Express, then click the forward button to upload the sketch to the Circuit Playground Express. 

Class 3 PREREQUISITES 


    Download TouchDesigner and sign up for a free license so you can use the software! Feel free to have a look at some introductory tutorials beforehand but it’s not required! I highly recommend this series by Matthew Ragan.
    Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system
    If you are using WINDOWS install the driver.
    Install SAMD Boards
    Install the Circuit Playground Library
    Download all course materials from Github
    Make sure your Circuit Playground Express is working and you can upload / run code! To test this, try uploading the Hello_Blink sketch and see if the red indicator LED blinks! If you need help, visit the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express‘s help section.
    Note: we will not be covering Arduino basics or setting up the Circuit Playground in this class, but feel free to review the first week’s course materials using the slideshow below!
    Recommended: download some video files you want to make art with! For some places to grab royalty free video, I recommend the following sources: MazWai, Pexels, Coverr, Videvo, Mixkit, Pixabay, Videezy. You can also download any of the videos I’ll be using for examples (Pexel user listed) from Drive here.’
    Recommended: I recommend using a mouse with a scroll wheel in Touchdesigner but this is not required.
